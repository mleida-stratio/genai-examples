    Starts a stand-alone GenAI-api-like server with the chain loaded so that in can be easily executed locally.
    Note that the chain will need access to a Genai-Gateway server, which could be provided from your
    local machine via the GenAI development proxy. An example of json body to send in invoke POST is
    ```json
       {
          "input": {
             "user_request": "Hi! Nice to meet you! Where's the Queen of Hearts?"
          },
          "config": {
            "metadata": {
              "__genai_state": {
                "client_auth_type": "mtls",
                "client_user_id": "Alice",
                "client_tenant": "s000001"
              }
            }
          }
       }
      ```
      The "config" -> "metadata" -> "__genai_state" is only needed to test while developing locally.
      In a real environment GenAI API adds automatically that fields from the auth info before
      passing the data to the chain
